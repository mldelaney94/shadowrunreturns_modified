"Sam, and maybe he or she slipped up with this latest victim, left some useful "
"evidence. Only one way to find out.\n"
"\n"
"South Seattle’s your typical industrial area: grit, grime, and grey. The rain "
"doesn’t help matters any. Layers of dirt mix with abandoned wooden pallets, "
"repurposed into makeshift furniture for the day workers. Garbage collects in the "
"gutters of the broken down street. “Disreputable” is this district’s middle "
"name.\n"
"\n"
"Your destination, the National Transportation Safety Board warehouse, is "
"located on a small strip of dock towards the less-maintained end of the "
"waterfront. Despite the presence of those who linger in such places, it's quiet "
"as you approach the gate. "
